      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered
        all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do.
        Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out
        there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record
        of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of
        Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that
        make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not
        into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks
        and iconic treks you’ll love, too.

        She has booked two major European trips for us 
        in the past year and every aspect has met, and in most 
        cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, best hotels, best 
        itineraries, and best cruises, she does it all. But the most important 
        thing is she remembers the little things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.

        Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 
        20 years and there is no one else I would trust to arrange my 
        trips and tours. I've also had great  fun on a few of the 
        group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 
        10-day cruise out of Venice and diving. It's always an 
        eclectic group of well traveled, interesting people
